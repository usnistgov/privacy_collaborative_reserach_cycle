        "privacy label detail": "These CRC submissions were made with High-Fidelity settings and use the original Deep NN architecture and optimal parameters to produce non-differentially private synthetic data. The YData Fabric Synthesizer tool also has embedded options for user selection of High-Privacy and Balanced Fidelity-Privacy; those options use a differential privacy mechanism to inject noise into the process of synthetic data generation.
