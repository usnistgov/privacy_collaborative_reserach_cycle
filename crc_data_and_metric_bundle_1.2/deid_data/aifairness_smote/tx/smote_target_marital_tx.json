        "privacy label detail": "The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) approach considers each record in the target data as a point in the feature space (i.e., in a schema with F features, this is an F-dimensional cartersian space with one axis per feature). It then uses a geometric technique such as linear interpolation or k-means clustering to select new points which lie between existing target points.  These new points comprise non-differentially private synthetic data which is very unlikely to contain individuals from the original target data. ",
