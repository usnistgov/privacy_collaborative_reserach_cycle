        "privacy label detail": "The approach consists of a fully synthetic dataset. CTGAN contributes to data privacy through synthetic data generation. It learns the statistical characteristics and dependencies of the original data through a generative adversarial network and then generates (non-differentially private) synthetic data that closely resembles the original data distribution.
